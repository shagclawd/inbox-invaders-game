REALTOR OUTREACH SCRIPTS

1) Cold DM (short)
Hey [Name] — quick one: I help solo realtors stop lead drop-off and missed transaction deadlines with a simple pipeline + compliance copilot setup. Usually live in 48h. Want a 2-minute breakdown?

2) Cold DM (value-first)
I audited 12 solo agent workflows this month and the biggest leak is delayed follow-up in the first 2 hours after inquiry. I build a lightweight system that handles response + reminders + deadline alerts. Want me to show what this looks like for your current pipeline?

3) Referral ask
If you know a realtor who’s great with clients but drowning in follow-up/admin, I built a service specifically for that: pipeline + compliance copilot. Happy to run a free workflow audit for one person you trust.

4) Email subject lines
- Quick fix for lead follow-up gaps
- Simple system to prevent missed contract deadlines
- 48h realtor pipeline + compliance setup

5) Follow-up nudge
Bumping this in case timing was bad — if your team has ever said “I thought someone followed up,” this is exactly what I solve.

1)
Most realtors don’t lose deals because of bad sales skills.
They lose deals because follow-up slips and deadlines get messy.

I’m launching a Realtor Pipeline + Compliance Copilot:
- faster lead response
- cleaner follow-up
- deadline safety net

2)
Your CRM is not broken.
Your operating cadence is.

If no one owns response time + deadline tracking, revenue leaks quietly.

3)
Realtors: if your transaction checklist lives in your head, you’re one busy week away from chaos.

Build systems, not stress.

4)
Speed to lead matters.
But so does speed to *second* and *third* follow-up.
That’s where most commissions are won.

5)
I’m taking 3 pilot realtor clients:
$149 setup + $149 first month.
You get pipeline + compliance copilot in 48h.
DM “COPILOT” if you want details.
